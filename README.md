# Toronto Neighborhoods Profiles (2021) – Data Analysis

**Project Overview**  
This project analyzes Toronto’s 2021 open neighborhood dataset, uncovering trends and insights across 140+ urban regions. The goal was to clean, process, and visualize a complex municipal dataset to understand demographic, social, and economic patterns.

**Key Features**
- Analyzed 2600+ records with 159 features using pandas and NumPy for advanced data wrangling and numerical operations.
- Built a custom Python data-cleaning pipeline to restructure raw data, remove unnecessary metadata, and standardize mixed-type fields.
- Developed clear Matplotlib visualizations and interactive Tableau dashboards to effectively communicate data-driven insights.
- Enhanced real-world data wrangling, statistical analysis, and data storytelling skills.

**Tech Stack**
- Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), Tableau

**How to Run**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Load the dataset (`toronto_neighbourhoods_2021.csv`).
3. Run provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for cleaning and analysis.
4. Explore visual outputs in Matplotlib or open Tableau dashboards for interactive exploration.

**Deliverables**
- Python scripts / Jupyter notebooks
- Cleaned dataset outputs
- Matplotlib visualizations
- Tableau dashboard (packaged workbook or screenshots)

**Project Status**
✅ Completed and available for review.
